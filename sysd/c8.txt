why study bigtable implementation?
gfs or hadoop, why need bigtable? 
qeury the value of a specific attribute. scenario: search value for a key
using file, binary search
scenario 2: update the value for a key, using file is time consumuing
for the fast writing, append to the end of file
but what about reading? read all values for the key. 
how to enable both binary search and appending to the end?
sorted in each parition/chunk, the last parition is not sorted.  
issues: there will be more and more partitions, search all partitions takes long time.
solution: k ways merge sort once in a while. 

write a key value pair to disk
an efficient way: append and sorted in memory block, then serialize to disk once for all.  
but problem: what if the machine would go down and lose the data in the memory? 
solution: write ahead log
