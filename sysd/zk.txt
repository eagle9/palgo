CAP thereom
A distributed system can not satisfy the following three properties:  Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance. 
different client gets the same value of a key
service is always available.
examples to trade off CAP. Partioned, TO keep A, give up consistency, makes senses; Or give up A, keep consistency.
What is consistency?
consistency model
weak consistency
  eventual consistency
	DNS
	Gossip (Cassandra)
Strong consistency, widely used 
Problems? 
	fault tolerance.  achieve it with state machine replication concensus algorithm
    paxos 
Strong consistency -- master slave syncronizaiton
master accept write request -> master copy log to slaves -> master wait for all slave completion
problem found: any slave failure leads to master blocking and entire cluster becomes not available.

Strong consistency -- majority wins
	write to and read from more than N/2 nodes
    problem?  concurrent update order 

Strong consistency - Paxos
   basic paxos, multi paxos

Strong consistency - Raft and zab. 
   term by term, elect a leader. start with followers, no info from leader, a follower becomes a candidate, send vote to other followers, who cast the vote back to the leader, as long as majority( quorum) send vote back, the candidate becomes a leader.   client update the value of a key, leader write log first, then notify its followers to update and log, as long as majority followers done update and send confirmation back to leader, leader finish the update and log, and now concensus is reached in the distributed system.
