application-specific thread schedulers can tune an application better than the kernel

switch between threads inside a single process is more efficient
switch between processes is more costly

round robin scheduling --- setting the quantum too short causes too many process switches and lowers the cpu efficiency, setting too long cause poor response to short interactive requests. trade off ---  a quantum around 20-50 msec often a reasonable trade off
