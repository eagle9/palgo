use a queue
if empty queue, consumer should wait with condition to be notified
if queue is full, producer should wait with condition to be notified
use lock, condition
or use queue with concurrency control

list of urls is 1 trillion, what's the problem with url queue? 
in memory queue is not large enough, 40TB
queue does not support other attributes associated with url to crawl, such as priority, state, available time, and so on. 
so url queue ---> task table

how to handle dead cycle of url links? 


schedule grab urls from task table, same site prefix(from yahoo.com) urls should be less than a quota(say 10%)
