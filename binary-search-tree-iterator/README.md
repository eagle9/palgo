86. Binary Search Tree Iterator
Description
Design an iterator over a binary search tree with the following rules:

Elements are visited in ascending order (i.e. an in-order traversal)
next() and hasNext() queries run in O(1) time in average.
Example
For the following binary search tree, in-order traversal by using iterator is [1, 6, 10, 11, 12]

   10
 /    \
1      11
 \       \
  6       12
Challenge
Extra memory usage O(h), h is the height of the tree.

Super Star: Extra memory usage O(1)
