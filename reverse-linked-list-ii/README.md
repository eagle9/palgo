36. Reverse Linked List II
Reverse a linked list from position m to n.

Example
Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL, m = 2 and n = 4, return 1->4->3->2->5->NULL.

Challenge
Reverse it in-place and in one-pass, 

Notice
Given m, n satisfy the following condition: 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ length of list.

Difficulty: medium
compared to reverse linked list, which is to reverse the entire list
kind of tricky, use a simple example to figure out all the details. 

jz and jiadai, similar, i would say jz's code is easier to read, you have to use several assistant variables
