516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence
Medium

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:
Input: "bbbab"
Output: 4

One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
Example 2:
Input: "cbbd"
Output: 2

One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
