Description
Given a collection of candidate numbers (C) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.

Each number in C may only be used once in the combination.

All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
Elements in a combination (a1, a2, … , ak) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a1 ≤ a2 ≤ … ≤ ak).
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
Example
Given candidate set [10,1,6,7,2,1,5] and target 8,

A solution set is:

[
  [1,7],
  [1,2,5],
  [2,6],
  [1,1,6]
]

Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sums to target.

Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.

Note:

All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
Example 1:

Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8,
A solution set is:
[
  [1, 7],
  [1, 2, 5],
  [2, 6],
  [1, 1, 6]
]
Example 2:

Input: candidates = [2,5,2,1,2], target = 5,
A solution set is:
[
  [1,2,2],
  [5]
]
