852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array
Easy 308 712 Favorite Share

Let's call an array A a mountain if the following properties hold:

A.length >= 3
There exists some 0 < i < A.length - 1 such that A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i] > A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1]
Given an array that is definitely a mountain, return any i such that A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i] > A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1].

Example 1:
Input: [0,1,0]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: [0,2,1,0]
Output: 1
Note:

3 <= A.length <= 10000
0 <= A[i] <= 10^6
A is a mountain, as defined above.
