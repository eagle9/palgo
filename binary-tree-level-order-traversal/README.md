# 69. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Difficulty: Easy

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

**Example**  
Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

return its level order traversal as:
```
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]
```
jiadai use bfs, same idea as what's in jz's
