307. Range Sum Query - Mutable
Medium
Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

The update(i, val) function modifies nums by updating the element at index i to val.

Example:

Given nums = [1, 3, 5]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 9
update(1, 2)
sumRange(0, 2) -> 8
Note:

The array is only modifiable by the update function.
You may assume the number of calls to update and sumRange function is distributed evenly.

classical use of Binary indexed tree
parent child relationship:  index 0 is dummy node that does not store any array element, init as 0
each node has an index,   dummpy node index 0 will be the parent.  node with index i, take it binary representation, flip the last 1 bit, you get another smaller index, which is the parent. 
bi tree is used to store prefix sum of the array.  How ???
