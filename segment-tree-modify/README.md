203. Segment Tree Modify
Description
For a Maximum Segment Tree, which each node has an extra value max to store the maximum value in this node's interval.

Implement a modify function with three parameter root, index and value to change the node's value with [start, end] = [index, index] to the new given value. Make sure after this change, every node in segment tree still has the max attribute with the correct value.

We suggest you finish problem Segment Tree Build and Segment Tree Query first.

Example
For segment tree:

                      [1, 4, max=3]
                    /                \
        [1, 2, max=2]                [3, 4, max=3]
       /              \             /             \
[1, 1, max=2], [2, 2, max=1], [3, 3, max=0], [4, 4, max=3]
if call modify(root, 2, 4), we can get:

                      [1, 4, max=4]
                    /                \
        [1, 2, max=4]                [3, 4, max=3]
       /              \             /             \
[1, 1, max=2], [2, 2, max=4], [3, 3, max=0], [4, 4, max=3]
or call modify(root, 4, 0), we can get:

                      [1, 4, max=2]
                    /                \
        [1, 2, max=2]                [3, 4, max=0]
       /              \             /             \
[1, 1, max=2], [2, 2, max=1], [3, 3, max=0], [4, 4, max=0]
Challenge
Do it in O(h) time, h is the height of the segment tree.
