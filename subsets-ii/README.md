18. Subsets II
Description
Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, nums, return all possible subsets (the power set).

Each element in a subset must be in non-descending order.
The ordering between two subsets is free.
The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
Example
Input: [1,2,2]
Output:

[
  [2],
  [1],
  [1,2,2],
  [2,2],
  [1,2],
  []
]
Challenge
Can you do it in both recursively and iteratively?
