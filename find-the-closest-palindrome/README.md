564. Find the Closest Palindrome
Hard
Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome.

The 'closest' is defined as absolute difference minimized between two integers.

Example 1:
Input: "123"
Output: "121"
Note:
The input n is a positive integer represented by string, whose length will not exceed 18.
If there is a tie, return the smaller one as answer.

Hint 1:
Will brute force work for this problem? Think of something else.
Hint 2:
Take some examples like 1234, 999,1000, etc and check their closest palindromes. How many different cases are possible?
Hint 3:
Do we have to consider only left half or right half of the string or both?
Hint 4:
Try to find the closest palindrome of these numbers- 12932, 99800, 12120. Did you observe something?
