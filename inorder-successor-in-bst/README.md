448. Inorder Successor in BST
Description
Given a binary search tree (See Definition) and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.

If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return null.

It's guaranteed p is one node in the given tree. (You can directly compare the memory address to find p)

Example
Given tree = [2,1] and node = 1:

  2
 /
1
return node 2.

Given tree = [2,1,3] and node = 2:

  2
 / \
1   3
return node 3.

Challenge
O(h), where h is the height of the BST.
