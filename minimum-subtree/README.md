lintcode 596. Minimum Subtree
Given a binary tree, find the subtree with minimum sum. Return the root of the subtree.

Example
Given a binary tree:

     1
   /   \
 -5     2
 / \   /  \
0   2 -4  -5 
return the node 1.

Notice
LintCode will print the subtree which root is your return node.
It's guaranteed that there is only one subtree with minimum sum and the given binary tree is not an empty tree.
