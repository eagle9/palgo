486. Merge K Sorted Arrays
medium

Given k sorted integer arrays, merge them into one sorted array.

Example
Given 3 sorted arrays:

[
  [1, 3, 5, 7],
  [2, 4, 6],
  [0, 8, 9, 10, 11]
]
return [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].

Challenge
Do it in O(N log k).

N is the total number of integers.
k is the number of arrays.

correlate with external merge sorting, which is used to sort a big array that is too big for a single machine's memory
