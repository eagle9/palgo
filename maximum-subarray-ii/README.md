42. Maximum Subarray II
Description
Given an array of integers, find two non-overlapping subarrays which have the largest sum.
The number in each subarray should be contiguous.
Return the largest sum.

The subarray should contain at least one number

Example
For given [1, 3, -1, 2, -1, 2], the two subarrays are [1, 3] and [2, -1, 2] or [1, 3, -1, 2] and [2], they both have the largest sum 7.

Challenge
Can you do it in time complexity O(n) ?
