347. Top K Frequent Elements
Medium

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
Note:

You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
