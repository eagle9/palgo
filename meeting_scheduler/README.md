develop a meeting scheduler for a team of people. Each person has a calendar which is a list of meetings, or indicated by a list of intervals (start_hour, end_hour). Find all time intervals that can be used to schedule meetins for all team members. 

for example, given person A calendar: [(2,4), (6,7)] and person B's calendar [(3,5),(6,9)], the time windows are:[(0,2),(5,6),(9,24)]
