takes a little time to understand the problem details
also details to get neighbors function, but you can implement it later
idea forming:

i =1 to N*N
each step at row, col and seq no x
for x, get next row col pairs
can reach:  b[row][col] == -1? reach square x+i
            !=-1,  reach square b[][]
            
            
think of square as the node
each squre can reach a bunch of other squares,  total N*N squares
now find the shortest distance from square 1 to N*N
bfs natural solution
