grep -v ^$ doc/rounds
each type 10-20
solve a batch of problem of similar type
first round: 5 min thinking, no idea, learn
second round: try to get accepted within 30min, otherwise learn
third round: try to get accepted within 20min, otherwise learn
prefer solution that is faster than 70% 
read other people's code, c++ as well
my own tip: speak your mind when thinking and coding
habit: time space complexity study

clafficiation 
https://www.jianshu.com/p/5fbd07d557a3   ---- binary tree, studied
check my lt_progress sheet
word break ii done with dfs with memo
design autocomplete ----

strstr ii, n-queens
reverse, permutation, combination, more dp
dfs, bfs very bad 
get to 200, 300, 400, 500
