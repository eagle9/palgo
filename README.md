Algorithms in Java, C++, Python
===============================
- Python rich builtin and terse syntax enables you to write concise code, which is easy to understand and remember, and you can focus more on algorithms themselves
- Key python functions and collections
- Algorithms and data structures
- Machine learning, ml, nndl(neural network and deep learning) 

TODO
=====
strstr ii, n-queens
reverse, permutation, combination, more dp
dfs, bfs very bad 
get to 200, 300, 400, 500

ml tried kmeans, with sklearn iris data set and driver data set from datascienceinc, tried to visualize data and results, to understand kmeans more. driver data analysis centriods do not much the blog, why?  to study more
