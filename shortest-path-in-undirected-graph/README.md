814. Shortest Path in Undirected Graph
Description
Give an undirected graph, in which each edge's length is 1, and give two nodes from the graph. We need to find the length of the shortest path between the given two nodes.

Example
Given graph = {1,2,4#2,1,4#3,5#4,1,2#5,3}, and nodeA = 3, nodeB = 5.

1------2  3
 \     |  | 
  \    |  |
   \   |  |
    \  |  |
      4   5
return 1.
