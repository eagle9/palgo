Rob pike - Simplicity is complicated
   algo his talk about go lang design and assembler

right set of features, not jam lots of features and think it is good
   a lot of other languages are converging by adding more and more similar features

orthogonal features, not diagonal
1 way to create app or system, not multiple ways
readability, easy to work on, easy to fix, wide use

channel, goroutine, select(coordination)
interface and package
gc (not in golang spec)
be simple is complicated

pick up key features from java apparently
