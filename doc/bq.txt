Shane Chang  <<behavior interview questions >> summary
your fit to the job is evaluated 
at two major dimensions:
time: past now and future -- how you handle past projects, what you are pursuing career development
  prove yourself problem solving, interactions with people, collegues, supervisors, clients, suppliers
 enthusiasm : study the stategies of the new employer, align with the direction of your dream? 
future career development: 
personality: optimistic candidates are more attractive, show a bright positive attitude  
introduce yourself/tell me about yourself/tell me about your background
 --- easest but the most important
tell your qualifications fitting the job requirements.  education, work experience. elaborate course work,
projects, activities relevant to the job opportunity. activities and projects are better be told by examples, scenarios
--attack -- outcome approach

rule of thumb is to prepare several 3-5 impressive stories, each of which comes from a distinct perspective
  senarios -- attack --- outcome/impact
for each story, prepare two different version: short (1 minute) and long (4-5 min)

bring the copy of your resume, which serves as a cheat sheet for you to tell the prepared stories


What was your last project? 
should be quite relevant to the job you are applying, skills to be extended immediately to the new job
any project in the past 1-2 years counts
usually multiple projects during a period, need to handle the in parallel.  
give one of the recent projects that resulted in a good outcome

tell the recent project story with SAO approach. how you handle the project from beginning to end? describe the process
of the project.  the story should come with a good result that proves your effective strategic thinking or management
capability
