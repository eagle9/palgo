Agile Scrum vs. Kanban
scrum feature and functions are clear
less change, speed of feature delivery is key
scrum master -> scrum team
planning meeting -> daily stand up -> retrospective meeting(good and area for improvement)
backlog of work items
pull item according to priority from backlog

from planning, to design, testing, release
a sprint is a short software development cycle 1-4 weeks
once in requirments, no change until next sprint


kanban -- feature not clear, frequent change, release more frequent
kanban board:
to do, in progress, done
requirement can be changed, so more flexible
