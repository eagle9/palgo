hadoop made more effective realtime system
paper notes
tradeoffs 
a combination of large clusters of mysql databases 
and caching tiers built using memached. 
it is difficult to scale up mysql clusters rapidly
while maintaining good load balancing and high uptime. 
500 millions users, many petabytes of data
facebook messages. 
specific improvements made to hdfs and hbase to enable 
them to scale to big workload 

workload types
1.high write throughput
  millions of messages and billions of instant mesg daily
2.large tables
  each mailbox will grow indefinitely
  messages are read only a number of times
3. migration
  
avarta nodes wrapper of name node
still not clear about what improvements 
reading such paper reward is very slight
