Java Performance: The Definite Guide

C3. Java performance tool box

c4. Working with the JIT compiler

c5. Introduction to garbage collection
 read this chapter first pass. It makes sense, good read. 4 GC, all for heap. 
serial, throughput, cms, g1
cms and g1 are parallel, g1 partition heap and works better with larger heap size.
heap divided into generations
permgen jdk7 metaspace jdk8 store class metadata
-XX:Xms -XX:Xmx, initial size and max size. GC will find the proper heap size
max usually 1/4 of the physical RAM size
start your program and run to its full capacity (all data and max connections), use jconsole and run a full GC

GC pause (stop the world), application threads will be paused
permance penalty, with simplified memory management
GC pause can be tunned
minor GC cyle, finding and marking unused memory inside the heap
full GC cyle, heap unused memory removal and compaction

c6. Garbage collection algorithms
