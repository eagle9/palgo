Medium 1447 41 Favorite Share

Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

Note: The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000]. Each temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100].

Hint 1
If the temperature is say, 70 today, then in the future a warmer temperature must be either 71, 72, 73, ..., 99, or 100. We could remember when all of them occur next.
