Approach #3: Line Sweep
runtime 51ms, faster than 63%

Intuition

Imagine we pass a horizontal line from bottom to top over the shape. We have some active intervals on this horizontal line, which gets updated twice for each rectangle. In total, there are 2 * N2âˆ—N events, and we can update our (up to NN) active horizontal intervals for each update.

Algorithm

For a rectangle like rec = [1,0,3,1], the first update is to add [1, 3] to the active set at y = 0, and the second update is to remove [1, 3] at y = 1. Note that adding and removing respects multiplicity - if we also added [0, 2] at y = 0, then removing [1, 3] at y = 1 will still leave us with [0, 2] active.

This gives us a plan: create these two events for each rectangle, then process all the events in sorted order of y. The issue now is deciding how to process the events add(x1, x2) and remove(x1, x2) such that we are able to query() the total horizontal length of our active intervals.

We can use the fact that our remove(...) operation will always be on an interval that was previously added. Let's store all the (x1, x2) intervals in sorted order. Then, we can query() in linear time using a technique similar to a classic LeetCode problem, Merge Intervals.
