150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
Medium 564 365 Favorite Share

Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.

Valid operators are +, -, *, /. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

Note:

Division between two integers should truncate toward zero.
The given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result and there won't be any divide by zero operation.

Example 1:
Input: ["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9

Example 2:
Input: ["4", "13", "5", "/", "+"]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6

Example 3:
Input: ["10", "6", "9", "3", "+", "-11", "*", "/", "*", "17", "+", "5", "+"]
Output: 22
Explanation: 
  ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22
