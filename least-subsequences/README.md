lintcode 1645. Least Subsequences
Description
Given an array with n integers. Splitting it into subsequences of strictly descending order.
Output the minimum number of subsequences you can get by splitting.

Example
Input: [5,2,4,3,1,6]
Output: 3

Explanation:
 You can split this array into : [5,2,1], [4,3], [6]. And there are 3 subsequences you get.ï»¿ 
Or you can split it into [5, 4, 3],[2,1], [6] also 3 subsequences.
But [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [6] is not legal because [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] is not a subsuquence of the original array.
input: [1, 1, 1]
Output: 3
Explanation: Because of the strictly descending order you must split it into 3 subsequences: [1],[1],[1]
Challenge
Deal it with the complexity: o(nlogn)
