Given a 2D grid, each cell is either an house 1 or empty 0 (the number zero, one), find the place to build a post office, the distance that post office to all the house sum is smallest. Return the smallest distance. Return -1 if it is not possible.

Notice

You can pass through house and empty.
You only build post office on an empty.
Example
Given a grid:

0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0
return 6. (Placing a post office at (1,1), the distance that post office to all the house sum is smallest.)
