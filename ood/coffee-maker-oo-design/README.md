设计一个自动咖啡机，加入一袋咖啡包，简单地煮一杯咖啡。

每个咖啡包包含有咖啡的配方，如加入了多少牛奶，或加入了多少糖
咖啡机可根据咖啡包提供的配方制作咖啡
只考虑两种成分成分：糖（sugar）和牛奶（milk）
普通咖啡的成本是2元。 加入一份牛奶或糖会使成本增加0.5元
考虑使用Decorator Design Pattern

Can you design a coffee maker, that take a coffee pack, and can simply make a cup of coffee.

Coffee pack contains the recipe of the coffee, like how many milk / how many sugar to be added in the coffee
Coffee maker can make coffee based on the recipe provided by the coffee pack
Only consider 2 type of ingredients: sugar and milk
the cost of Plain coffee is 2. Add one portion of milk/sugar will increase the cost by 0.5
Consider use decorator design pattern
