# 597. Subtree with Maximum Average

Difficulty: Easy

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/subtree-with-maximum-average/

Given a binary tree, find the subtree with maximum average. Return the root of the subtree.

**Notice**  
LintCode will print the subtree which root is your return node.  
It's guaranteed that there is only one subtree with maximum average.

**Example**  
Given a binary tree:
```
     1
   /   \
 -5     11
 / \   /  \
1   2 4    -2 
```
return the node 11.
