Hard
Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

Example:
Input: 
words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"] and board =
[
  ['o','a','a','n'],
  ['e','t','a','e'],
  ['i','h','k','r'],
  ['i','f','l','v']
]
Output: ["eat","oath"]
Note:
You may assume that all inputs are consist of lowercase letters a-z.

Topic: Backtracking, Trie
Similar: word search
Hints: 
You would need to optimize your backtracking to pass the larger test. Could you stop backtracking earlier?

If the current candidate does not exist in all words' prefix, you could stop backtracking immediately. What kind of data structure could answer such query efficiently? Does a hash table work? Why or why not? How about a Trie? If you would like to learn how to implement a basic trie, please work on this problem: Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) first.

Description
Given a matrix of lower alphabets and a dictionary. Find all words in the dictionary that can be found in the matrix. A word can start from any position in the matrix and go left/right/up/down to the adjacent position. One character only be used once in one word.

Example
Given matrix:
doaf
agai
dcan
and dictionary: {"dog", "dad", "dgdg", "can", "again"}
return {"dog", "dad", "can", "again"}

dog:
doaf
agai
dcan

dad:
doaf
agai
dcan

can:
doaf
agai
dcan

again:
doaf
agai
dcan

Challenge
Using trie to implement your algorithm.
