652. Factorization
A non-negative numbers can be regarded as product of its factors.
Write a function that takes an integer n and return all possible combinations of its factors.

Example
Given n = 8
return [[2,2,2],[2,4]]
// 8 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 2 x 4.

Given n = 1
return []

Given n = 12
return [[2,6],[2,2,3],[3,4]]

Notice
Elements in a combination (a1, a2, … , ak) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a1 ≤ a2 ≤ … ≤ ak).
The solution set must not contain duplicate combination.
