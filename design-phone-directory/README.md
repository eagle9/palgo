Medium 134 215 Favorite Share

Design a Phone Directory which supports the following operations:

get: Provide a number which is not assigned to anyone.
check: Check if a number is available or not.
release: Recycle or release a number.

Example:
// Init a phone directory containing a total of 3 numbers: 0, 1, and 2.
PhoneDirectory directory = new PhoneDirectory(3);

// It can return any available phone number. Here we assume it returns 0.
directory.get();

// Assume it returns 1.
directory.get();

// The number 2 is available, so return true.
directory.check(2);

// It returns 2, the only number that is left.
directory.get();

// The number 2 is no longer available, so return false.
directory.check(2);

// Release number 2 back to the pool.
directory.release(2);

// Number 2 is available again, return true.
directory.check(2);
