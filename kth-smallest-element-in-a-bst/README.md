902. Kth Smallest Element in a BST
Description
Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

Example
Given root = {1,#,2}, k = 2, return 2.

Challenge
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
